            <h2>ONE PLUS</h2>
            <p>However, when it came time to launch the phone in India, Cyanogen informed OnePlus that it had an existing exclusive deal with Yu, a brand by Micromax. An Indian court suspended sales of the OnePlus phone.This pushed the company to develop in-house software – OxygenOS for the global market and HydrogenOS for China. OnePlus released those as installable ROMs in early 2015, though the software took a while to become stable enough for daily use.Still, the writing was on the wall for Cyanogen Inc. The company’s CEO and namesake boasted that it will wrestle control of Android away from Google, but in no small part due to the OnePlus fiasco, other makers didn’t sign on to use its software.That’s not to say that OnePlus One didn’t get its fair share of third-party ROMs.</p>
